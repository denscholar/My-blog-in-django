## My Personal blog in Django

I am currently learning Django and the best way to learn and learn fast is to build projects. This is my first Django project as it was an opportunity to have embarked on such project. In the course of building this blog, I had the opportunity of learning so many things. Please, I would also appreciate constructive feedback as to how best I can further improve on it. 

However, the project is also a work-in-progress as more functionalities will be added to it as I continue in my learning process. functionailities such as ```searches```, ```pagination```, adding a ```rich text editor``` when user wants to add post, add ```comment``` section etc.
